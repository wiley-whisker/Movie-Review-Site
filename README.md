# Movie-Review-Site
Repository for the Django project used to deploy my implementation of a text sentiment analyzer trained on movie reviews.

Link to deployed Heroku app: https://protected-garden-36914.herokuapp.com/ (may take a few seconds to boot upon initial request)

Currently, the contents of this repository are in the process of being moved from the original repo on my RIT CS Guthub account. The process cannot be a simple ownership transfer because of security problems that would be caused by making the original repo and commit history public.
